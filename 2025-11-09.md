user
accept, rejected, reserved, booked, 

ADMIN
cancel, booking request (idk what status it will send)

based on the status we need to figureout who to send the notification  basically who is the reciver and who is sender right
-ADMIN
-USER

first i have to update the current sent-notification that also send the status
and based on that status will will compose a message if admin send notification to the student sender will be the business name and also compose a message in good way
in the backend  i want new route  that handle the message that change the structre of the request based on the status
need to figureout who to send the notification  basically who is the reciver and who is sender right
status is the booking status
by based on that status need to figureot who send a notifiocation 
admin send a message to user we will give the business name in the req so user will undernad this hostel(hostel) send me a notification
if use send a message need to show the username
admin will know like this user send a booking req or cancel booking and so on

make a new route that take the sender name and reciver fcm token
we will compose a notifion based on the booking status
if the user trigger a notification app mode should(idk) i mean admin only see the message only after switch to that business
also figreout the payload to get notification after business switch


i want you to see the frontend asn see the current backend
we are making a new routes
in the req
{
  "fcmTokens": [

      }
    }
  }
}

what to add and what to remove


we have the folling status

 REJECTED = 'Rejected',-admin do
 CONFIRMED = 'Confirmed',-> admin do 
  CANCELLED = 'Cancelled', -->/student do
  REQUESTED -> Requested' -->user do


also in the current fronted for admin to get the notification he need to switch the business right? for backend i think we need to use app mode to another(i do know the name) right not the user 




MEM0 AND THE EXTRANAL SOURCE


also we need a tap actions if the user get the notification it always redirect into the booking list/ my booking page & also see what paload need to send to get the notification for the admin  basicall we also need to handle the tap action
for to achive this what payload backed need to send and i want you fully analyze and scan the fornted to understand the hostel stuff & other related stuff




i have a backend where we can do the all hostel relateed api and evertything understand the booking flow  and also figureout the how we take the user and businessiinfo from another micoservice and so on
basically form this server we are going to use the notification server
i watn you to figureout the places where we are going to use the notification
for now only this booking flow nothing else
also figureotut how we are able make the reqest format that this  hostel notifiocna server accept
to get the sender name i want a method that give me the sender information
for user query by userId for business business query buisness
for quick i want you check weather we already have the api for getting those buisness and businesinfo 
for business we have to get the


i just want to you figureout what you need to send in req for notifion-server currnent
also figureout how we gateher request payload

also tell me you confusion as well do not jump into the code first we just brainstorm
if you understand iam going to give the the hostel-server


can we test without testing? break it down and test that thing seprately and figureout the changes and learning based on that and implement in the actual


when you work on the project use the 2 SERVERS one for actual code and another for the playground workaround and testing 

CAN MAKE A ASSUMETION AND PROBABLITY TO MAKE SURE IT WILL WORK WITHOUT
TESTING THE ACTUAL THING?
