ATTENDANCE


HOSTEL DATABASE GATHERING THE DOCUMENTATION AND  THE FINAL FLOW
FIRUREOUT THE SMART WAY YOU CAN TEST THE PARTICULAR THING SEPRATELY

understand the current flow
main thing is configure  money is not the money that given money this is just an configuration done by admin e.g sutendet(essor) montly amount is 60000. is the configureout amount and  the user will pay that amount later iam whereever like mid of the month initally
we also do not have to add in the payment table and the calcluation of checkout process is check the user current amount  payment is there there any extra amount or user have to pay we will calcuated that and checkout that will be the flow
currently we use the configure amount seprate and did touch until checkout right
we do not want that  we do not have to add that amount anywhere that is just confure amount
first tell me what you understand from my request need question to make sure we are only same page
	


we have to change the logic
intially cofgure money something like to say your monthly amount is that
configure amount is one time cant create only admin can edit

currently how this intial configuration amount is working
how we treat that configured money as a receive money or this is just and cofigured money to know that student 
have to pay this amount base monthly or whatever
if we treat as a receive money  where it adds up?



when the user want to do the payment admin goes to the payment section add  the payment
there you check given payment and the actual configure payment monthly
if user add less that that montly it goes to the regular payment also you have to confim that edit money match the amount 
also we have the case where user give more that mohtly save as mothly match amoutn addtional goes to the regular amount

break it down 
make a sperate playground  gather the dependencies
