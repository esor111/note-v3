-WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL BUG TO FIX?

-
LADGER
NOTIFICATION
ATTENDANCE



ISSUES
-HOSTEL SEARCH NOT WORKINGS 
-### Today's Attendance not funcational
-when udpdate the layout even 
-layout update is not working properly
-bed count and the acutal bed we can add in the UI

-after updating the layout Loading rooms... (taking longer time why???)


in the /rooms route 
## Rooms

0 rooms • 0/0 beds occupied • 0% occupancy---> why always 0?




can we mimimize response data of rooms but preserving everything every required not for serveing ui , cuz i think the api response is very slow and showing the loading continuously
by peserving everything 



Updating the layout not working??--> also updating the layout is very slow?
can we optimaize that api and make it simple and efficiant if yes tell me how first lets brainstorm
what will be the best approach   may be use multiple api or ?? idk




before  telling me anything please analyze everything and figoureout where it effect also think like a smart enginner , we only change what is required to change not less and not more
![[Pasted image 20251025181911.png]]

please look at the req and response of api that we have use before and current  and also see the

i think we need to remove
# Kaha Control Center
Hostel Management System
Kaha Ready  --> that is on the top of ever page


how do we give the best ui for single bed , bunk bed, window , door

	collaps able sidbar and the main page
	
user is going to be distracted
ho


also in the bottom we have
💡 **Pro Tips:**• Drag elements smoothly to any position• Use arrow keys for precise movement• Hold Shift + arrows for fine adjustments• Right-click for context menu

i also no need this i fell this is unnecessary
also one of thing i really concren is we have this UI
we have in every page right i want to remove this one  i want you view how can we safely remove this without changing other functionality? first plan and tell me? you idea



issues::
we have sidebar and the main page right when i scrolll the main page sidebar also scroll right can we do somethinglike sidbar collapase able and then that is not scrool and  only the main page is scrool can we do this safely  without changing other functionality? before doing i want you to analyze and understand what si the currect codebase what need to change  how can we do this effectlivey and be 120% cofindent and then we will start task  iam taking about hostel ladger
http://localhost:8080/ledger page


elements section look so janky looking they i over each other  and for each coponet vertical space is really very small 


one of the problem is when i add the room  i can add the bedcount  in the ui supponse i add the bed count 3 in the UI i can add the whatever count of bed no restriction since i have add set the bed count 3 i only can  have to add the only 3 bed isnt it ?==

in the room listing image is not showing why figureout and solve it
in the response backend give the empty images what is problem please firguroeut 
which api use for creating room in the frontend or investigate is that images pass in the requrest or not everything investigate it only fully analyze do not code for now

showing occupany rate 


remove save and exit button only save button is fine
and also i want to add the 39.4 ft × 32.8 ft in the top in the layout





### Student Status Distribution

Breakdown of students by their current status in the hostel

is this also showing static?


##   
⚡ Admin Charging System
now working anything properly i want you to anzlyze the whhole codebase fronte-end backend 
first figureout what are the actions , what are trigger , if something create where it going to change
meaning just want you know the whole flow diffrent action user can can do and based on that action what are the places it will going to change || effect  and try whole flow figuouret where is the flow



make it clickable to that kaha logo and it will redirect into the dashboard scrren
http://localhost:8081/admin





minor fixes

nedd to remove api test menu


showing 
Current Occupancy Rate
Percentage of beds currently occupied
76% --fixed

Current Occupancy Rate
Percentage of beds currently occupied
89% --> is this fix?

make this widow default heigh small for that layout


user email is shwoing random?  

fix this search functionlity when i try to search every word i put there page kind of refresh scrreen blink  when search student also see is there other places this kind of issue? --> in so many search places i want you to figuroeut yourself and change where it requrire to change only

major 

one of the things missing here what about this bunk bed can we assume that double  to single bed in the booking we just user can book direcly that bunk bed without specifing the top or bottom  so i think we treat a single bed but ui and everytinng should as it it  
figureout where it effect or how we handle.
and also in most of the cases shoing Designer
3 beds in the actual ui we have 4 beds and 
and also in the room listing page 0/5 this but we only have 3 beds why this kind of issue please i want to understand everything how this working what might be the proble just brainstorm not code


hostel ladger sidebar not scroolable and another problme is i fyou see taking space from the top and side did you understand what i mean tell me first before code?

after doing everything need to remove the console logs

remove checkIn checkout option for now imean today attendace card

when i edit a room not working as expected edit the layout even if i have bed i have set hte bed count supponse 6  i have add add the 4 bed in the layout it is working but if i edet and make it add extra 2 beds also not working showing random like 0/1
even we have a beds in the layout i do understand what is the problme man




LETS TALK ABOUT LEDGER FLOW 
what are the things that effect the ladger

payment recording
discount management
admin charging

main thing is we have to make that ladger robost we have to do the calculation presisely carefully since we are giving for the hostel owner 
figureout what are things can change the   
📋 Student Ledger stuff like
payment recording, admin charging  

i need to figureout it is correctly working or not 

we need to figureout  if the student do the checkout  what happedn currectly and what should happen




wehn you edid the layout showign the big problem  currtly showing 0/2 this is fine
wehn i add the new bed in the layout  showin  0/1 what the helll is this?
this is crzy problem pleae i want you to figureout what is this exact problem understand througthly please understadn this trace go to the room cause of that  problem and tell the me problem and purpose the solution before anything


here i want  you think about this 
### Recent Activities
currently what are the actions we are taking as a recent actitives  and showing in that recent activites?




after i approve the configuration it need to redirect on #  Student Management
Enroll and manage student records <-this section understand??

i think we need to remove 
One-time Security Deposit:₹10,000





### Monthly Revenue

NPR 40,000

Current month

### Pending Payments

NPR 0

No pending payments

no the specific hostel data i think???


main thing you have to understad we assume single bed and multi bed 

you are shoing the some like 4 bed available 3 bed availabe and so
for this do not depend upon the backend just see the response bed list
if that status is available that beds are available ok understand


need to put automated billiing at last in the menu

in the booking detail page when i click on that

did you see the space taking this logo and our main contain in shwoing in the middle


IS THIS DASHBOARD IS HOSTEL WISE OR 
one of the main concern is we since we this is platform and hostel wise stuff
after switch the hostel it should show everything about that hostel 
for e.g dashboard, booking , students, analytics , hostel ladger only of that particular hostel we switch uderstnd  i watn you to deeply analyze the code and understand thoroughtly where if take the all hostel data and show insted that particular hostel 
this is one of the main concern this is high priority please go throughly









able add number invalid phone number??

dashboard random amount showing

need to remove some data from the payment  page

what about revinue  only pament (currently) or i have to add other whole amount
like: adding:: discount, advance , charging and so on (ask to who may concern)



figureout the checkout flow

make a shortcut to call your flow page for sterring (uderstadn-->ISHWOR)



need to remove student destribution




currently what is the role of bunk bed how this work it is different than the single bed
if i add the bunk bed what is flow current what are the places it effects?


when student checkout room should available
also it should be show in the recent activities



how when checkout what are the things will calculate 
his base monthly rate 
total money 
  -he pay
  -charges
  -discount
all will calculated copare with base monthly rate eiter deu or admin have to give my to  that student if  payment is higher?

one thing is what are student checkout in the middle of the month how we handle this?
we calculate that 15days money ?? also base on that will figuroeut the money to take from that student or take it? 



what is the current whole flow of the automated billing how the automated billing is calcualted right now?
change rule
initiallly admin set the base payment right when configuring the student --> that is his monthly money that user have to pay 

now the initial money  that student pay(monthly money) will be stay as it is 
meaning suppose user(student)  join hostel  to jan 2. this is not that jan month money
this money will be calculate at end of his checkout.  in the atomated billing we have show
February 2 amount remaning to pay (admin configure amount)  
in nepal it is practice admin take the whole month anoumnt initially and that money will only calculated where student  checkout from that hostel
this is my raw thoughts do you have better way or idea to handle this requirement 
make it accurate main thing is we have to make this system accurate. everything robust
not that wrong calcuation. cuz general public(studnet) and hostel owner going to use this in mass 

if anything not as it is or iam telling the wrong flow based on this codebase please  tell me 





		and also bed status is dynamic currenly when i see the layout?? 
for e.g when available color will be green , when reserved color should be yellow/orange and so on
what is in the current code

i also need to handle the room changin

default window & door size look so huge amke it so small

room and layout not working at expected i have to test it seprately

how this monthly base payment is calculated currently?

room


due is not working as exptected and properly what is the meaning of due?
in the current system what are the actions trigger due when due show in the screen
due( Outstanding Dues)


ATTENDANCE::
check in checkout system

businessId , userId
we do not ahave the user & business table on this project we take the data from another microservice  

also for now we do not 
each business has it own students each student have their attendace

mainly focus on checkIn checkOut  user can do multiple time in that business
and for the inital checkIn we can take this as a attendance we treat as a attendance
checkIn our attendances and we take out the report fom there

when user checkIn user going in request query we get the userId from the request 

we have report for the checkIn checkout  also we have report for attendance
here i talk about business but that is acutally hostel 
we have hostel hostel have student so on 

we do not have the time bound and the strict rule for checkIn and checkOut
one thing is initial checkIn going to happend admin configuration process when admin configure the student student automatically checkIn for the first time


bed availibity count so manythings are missing and update in the layout not the acutal table sometimes and something like this problem you need to figureout this everything trace youself createfull


layout and the json is not sysnc properly


in the edit showing default on price

in update also should update the fee base payment not showing when update

when charge happens it is subtract from the advance

MONTHLY PAYMENT HOW IT WORKS?

student detail financial information missing some node and calculation

ladger expand feature should remove

student charging pagination

when checkout need to unnecessary info

student status distrbution and occupancy tred should bremove fromt he analzytics section

when we create a room we do not have input for adding the foot of that room 

OTP LOGIN

student detail financial information missing some node and calculation

and also bed status is dynamic currenly when i see the layout?? 

need to manage and carefully update the trigger wise status when what status will change

automated billing
status


things to figureout 



WHAT YOU LEARN FROM BEES -->WON

both are api point the same place in the db for data?



based on this codebase i want you give me the flow of hostel status when this hostel status is change what are the trigggers FULLY
evertying what are the status list:
which api change the status & what is that status , what is initial status whole user flow



in the current process bed are showing in the layout but all the bed colors are green
even if bed status is changes  also supposed 


when admin try to delete the bed show pop up are sure and if that bed is reserved/booked  showing alrady have reserved/booked  so you cannot delete


current in the analytics section shhowing 
Current Occupancy Rate
Percentage of beds currently occupied
74%  --->i think this is hardcoded in the frontend
figureout why and i want you to make this dynamic put the actual data come from the api to achive that what exactly i need to change in the backend/frontend no code just to figureout the cause and anluze understannd it throughly and come of with concredte plan



here in the CURRENT SYSTEM how this automated billing is working  i want a full flow 
how it woks how the automated billing happens of the particular student how this process works?

what are we have in the UI related to the automated billing what are things admin can see or any can do or  tell me everthing & what are button we have E.G like view and also explain what that do



which amount user pay every month currently adminconfigured amount or ?
anything will calculate? what if admin change the confiureout amount in the middle of the month


in the automated billing section i think this NPR 75,000 Avg Monthly is hard coded?


I HAVE TO CHANGE THE FOLLING THING
advance is advance we do not calculate for any month or skip
e.g user pay the advance in the January2 ,
we have show due of that from that month january2 
 advance meaning no paymnet of any month
 that advance will calcualte when user checkout




I THINK WE HAVE TO REVAMP THAT USING THE NEPALI MONTH INSTED ENGLISH DATE
